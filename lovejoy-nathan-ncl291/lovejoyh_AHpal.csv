"TULEIL_2","Building block bearing 4-line inscription, introduced by full-height ruler figure facing right, beardless, with hair falling in bunch on nape, wearing long, fringed garment, carrying staff in left hand and pointing towards face with right hand in gesture expressing ""I am ..."". Of the inscription 1. 1, somewhat higher than 11. 2 —4, begins behind the figure's head and runs sinistroverse, continuing boustrophedon along 11. 2 — 4, ending lower right behind the figure's feet. L. 1 is very unusual, in that it consists mainly of a procession of animal and human figures. It is not clear whether these could represent writing and should be read.
